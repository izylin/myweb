    <h2>Hello! I’m Ziyue Lin 👋</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a second-year Software Engineering student who thrives in the balance between logic and creativity.<br/>
      On one hand, I enjoy clean code, clear structure, and solving algorithmic puzzles.<br/>
      On the other, I love spontaneous design ideas, trying new tech stacks, and letting curiosity guide me.
